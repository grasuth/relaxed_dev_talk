This is slides for a short talk about what I call Relaxed Development.

This talk in few lines:

* A combination of code reviews, testing and good standard makes development
  easy and fun.
* Git and github and github flow help a lot

And things to learn about github:

* You CAN do a pull request for branches in the same repo.  You don't have to 
  fork a repo to do that, and
* There are nice, very nice, line-by-line comments on pull requests, which
  works as a beautiful discussion tool for code reviews.

Slides prepared using deck.js (included, see separate licenses)

Feel free to remix, rework, reuse non-commercially as long as you credit me.

Enjoy!
